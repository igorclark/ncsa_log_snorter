Currently:

- Opens a log file & kicks off a list of X processes.
- Reads file, converts each line to binary & sends in a message to next process in list.
- Process parses line, returns list of {name,value} tuples containing the data.

Next steps:

- Obviously do something with the data
- Check out leex & yecc to do parsing properly
- Think about implementing as a state machine, for the lolz.
